Hello guys, this collapse jquery plugin was coded by myself. Feel free to use it.

1. Check code and set classes and settings that fit your project.

2. Call jQuery code like this:
    $(".yourSelector").HectixCollapse({
        visible_elements: 1, (numbers of elements, shown before clicking on button)
        animation_speed: 300, (animation speed of slide)
        items_per_click: 1 (items that will be displayed at once after clicking on button)
    });
    
3. Feel free to contant me.
